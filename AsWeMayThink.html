       With the way technology has been advancing for the sake of human service, Bush challenges scientists to go about creating technology that helped organize human knowledge instead of just solely physical assistance. His idea of the memex further interests me, as it is a device that assists individuals in organizing all their personal books, ideas, and communications that would normally just be stored in his own brain memory. Having them placed somewhere else allowsfor faster accessibility and reliability. Doing some further research, I have found that Vannevar Bush is considered to be the grandfather of hypertext, and his idea of a memex is used in Github itself. This is important because memex is one of the foundational concepts to inventing the World Wide Web. Despite these thoughts being recorded in 1945, his ideas stay prevelant to this day.
